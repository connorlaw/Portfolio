    'intro': `Luckily for me, when <a href="https://fantomfactory.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">Fantom Factory</a> embarked on a transformative journey to enhance their online education platform, they stumbled upon my radar. This marked the beginning of our collaboration, blossoming into a partnership where design took centre stage and development followed suit. The goal of our initial challenge was to both abstract and improve the look-and-feel of their primary platform - a job I was thoroughly looking forward to sinking my teeth into.`,
    'solution': `My initial focus was on creating a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that aligned with Fantom Factory's goals. The challenge extended beyond aesthetics, as it was crucial to empower the team at Fantom Factory to customise the resulting interface that would align to the branding of their third-party clients. As a solo web designer, I began with a comprehensive exploration of Fantom Factory's vision which later evolved into an extensive set of prototype designs, including branded versions that enabled the team to truly visualise their end goal.\n\nOnce the designs were tweaked, refined and agreed, I then utilised my skills as a developer to help build the templates for real-world use. While many projects rely on well-established platforms like WordPress, Fantom Factory had a unique approach. One of the founders, Steve Eynon, wrote a custom CSS pre-processor called FASS, based on the popular SCSS extension, that would work with the Slim templating engine. This bespoke solution allowed for tailored, cutting-edge templates and speedy development.\n\nAlongside this primary objective, I was also involved in many other projects on an ongoing basis, including design and development of bespoke elements for their data dashboards, directly improving their sales.`,
    'outcome': `The collaboration with Fantom Factory continues to yield exceptional results. Together, we have set the stage for a more engaging and effective educational platform, all while fostering a brilliant working partnership across multiple areas. Fantom Factory is benefiting from the flexibility and diverse expertise I provide, and the resulting work continues to excite the team and propel their business to new heights. It was, and continues to be, an awesome company to be a part of!`,

    'intro': `Brewbabu is a UK-based small business that specialises in selling hand-crafted teas and coffee blends. The company wanted a new website to showcase their products and make it easier for their customers to purchase online, as well as to tie-in with a wider online strategy aimed at spreading their reach to more potential customers. As a freelance web designer, I was hired to design, develop, and manage the project.`,
    'solution': `The first step was to create a design for the website that would meet Brewbabu's needs. I started by creating a wireframe to map out the layout and functionality of the site. Once the wireframe was approved, I moved on to the visual design phase, creating mockups of the site's main pages in Illustrator. I worked closely with the Brewbabu team to ensure that the design met their needs and that it was visually appealing to their target audience.\n\nOnce the design was finalised, I began building the site using <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>. Squarespace is a CMS that provides an easy-to-use platform for building and hosting websites. I created the site's pages and integrated the e-commerce section of the site, allowing customers to easily browse and purchase produccase-studies/ts. As part of setting up the e-commerce products, I even met with the team and assisted with the photography to ensure products were displayed in the most visually appealing and web-accessible way possible.\n\nOne of the challenges of the development phase was ensuring that the site was optimised for mobile devices. As more and more people browse the internet on their phones and tablets, it's important that websites are mobile-friendly. I made sure that the site was responsive and that it looked great on any device.\n\nAfter the site was built and launched, I provided training for the Brewbabu team so that they could manage the site themselves. I walked them through the Squarespace CMS and showed them how to update the site's content, add new products, and process orders. I also provided ongoing support to ensure that the site continued to run smoothly.`,
    'outcome': `Overall, the project was a success. The new website has improved Brewbabu's online presence and has made it easier for their customers to purchase their produccase-studies/ts. The use of Squarespace as a CMS allowed for an efficient development process, and the training provided ensured that the Brewbabu team was able to manage the site themselves.`,

    'intro': `As a designer and developer on the <a class="link" href="https://www.myeyesite.health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyEyeSite</a> project, I was part of a research and development collaboration with <a class="link" href="https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Moorfields Eye Hospital</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UCL</a> and my colleagues at <a class="link" href="https://loftdigital.com" target="_blank">Loft Digital</a> aimed at accelerating rare disease research and improving healthcare.\n\nOur challenge was to find a new approach that could empower patients to collect and share their specialist rare disease data, which is essential for scientists to develop precision genetic therapies for people with rare diseases. The challenge was that this data was difficult to collect as it had been generated in different clinical and community settings over the course of a patient's lifetime and was not linked. In addition, there was no system in place for rare disease doctors to see a full copy of a patient's clinical biography ahead of an appointment.\n\nMyEyeSite was developed to address these problems by providing a platform for patients to collect, link, and share their specialist rare disease data in a secure, systematic, and structured way.`,
    'solution': `Our team engaged patients, doctors, and researchers as collaborators to design and develop the MyEyeSite application. They carried out extensive user research and collaborative design sprints, held public patient days to garner wider input, and worked with the RNIB to ensure accessibility. They also spoke at many events and engaged with pharmaceutical companies to explore commercial interest.\n\nThe MyEyeSite application was designed to consist of a platform with interfaces (web or mobile) for patients to scan and manage their specialist medical and genetic data on a timeline, and to share this data with doctors, research studies, family, and friends in a secure, systematic, and structured way. We also developed an interface for doctors to review data shared with them in this way.`,
    'outcome': `The MyEyeSite project has received several awards and recognition, including an <a class="link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/news/2021/jun/ioo-day-2021-lecture-and-awards" target="_blank">IoO Public and Patient Involvement & Engagement Award in 2021</a>, an Innovate UK funding award winner in 2020, and an HDRUK funding award winner in 2019. We also published a paper in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) and presented at the ARVO 2021 conference. Short films about MyEyeSite were made by NIHR Moorfields BRC, and there were podcasts and films to introduce and explain the application.\n\nThe MyEyeSite application is available at <a class="link" href="https://www.myeyesite.health" target="_blank">www.myeyesite.health</a>, and it is expected to revolutionise the way patients with rare diseases share their data with doctors and researchers to accelerate their work.

    'intro': `Over the years that I worked at <a class="link" href="https://loftdigital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loft Digital</a> we evolved our company website a number of times as our services, focuses and targets changed. The final iteration that I worked on was, in my opinion, the best of the best! Working alongside our Frontend Lead Sam Scarles, we were tasked with designing and developing a new interface that would continue to use the same Wordpress CMS system that we had before. A new theme was needed...`,
    'solution': `To address this challenge, I worked closely with Sam to scope out and redesign the required pages and to deliver a more modern, user-friendly design.\n\nOnce the designs were finalised, we were also responsible for developing a number of custom, reusable blocks - as well as custom post types - to use across the site. This allowed us to ensure consistency across the website as well as put together many new pages at speed, as all blocks - once developed - were configured to be editable within the CMS.\n\nOnce the site was built and live, it was also my responsibility to develop new pages or blocks wherever needed, fix bugs, and enhance the site. Throughout this process, I relied on my extensive knowledge of PHP, plugin & Wordpress development, as well as my keen eye for design and attention to detail.`,
    'outcome': `I'm very happy with the way the site turned out - as I said in the introduction, of all our iterations we put together this is my favourite and best work. Thanks to the close collaboration between myself and Sam, we were able to develop a modular site that was adaptable, easy to use, and easy to maintain.`,

    'intro': `As a developer with a passion for both technology and travel, I saw an exciting opportunity to combine them into a project that was both meaningful and challenging.\n\nMy wife, Hannah, and I have always been avid travellers, and after our unforgettable six-month honeymoon adventure across Asia, we felt compelled to share our experiences, tips, and itineraries with a wider audience. This led to the creation of our travel blog, <a href="https://www.lawsoftravel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">Laws of Travel</a>, where we document our journeys and provide valuable insights to fellow travellers.\n\nThe site needed to be a reflection of our personalities, easy to navigate, visually engaging, and flexible enough to grow with our content. The challenge was to build a platform that could seamlessly combine our stories, photography, and travel advice in a way that was both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.`,
    'solution': `To bring Laws of Travel to life, I handled the full design and development process. Starting with Figma, I crafted a design that was clean, modern, and reflective of our travel style. The design focused on high-quality imagery, intuitive navigation, and a layout that could accommodate various types of content, such as blog posts and travel itineraries.\n\nOnce the design was finalised, I moved on to development, choosing WordPress as the platform due to its flexibility and scalability. Wanting full control of the underlying architecture, I built a custom theme from scratch. This allowed me to ensure that the website was optimised for performance, mobile-friendly, and tailored specifically to our needs. The custom theme also made it easier to implement unique features that could easily be updated as our travels continued.\n\nThroughout the development process, I focused on creating a seamless user experience, ensuring that visitors could easily find the content they were looking for, whether it was a detailed itinerary or a quick travel tip.`,
    'outcome': `The end result was <a href="https://www.lawsoftravel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">Laws of Travel</a> – a travel blog that not only captures the essence of our adventures but also serves as a valuable resource for other travellers.\n\nBy combining my technical expertise with our shared passion for travel, I was able to create a platform that is both functional and visually appealing. The site has received positive feedback from users who appreciate its design, ease of use, and the quality of content.\n\nAs we continue to explore new destinations, Laws of Travel will evolve with us, providing a space where we can share our journey with the world. This project has been a rewarding experience, blending creativity and technology to create something that is both personal and professional.`,
