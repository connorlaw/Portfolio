The challenge was that this data was difficult to collect as it had been generated in different clinical and community settings over the course of a patient\'s lifetime and was not linked. In addition, there was no system in place for rare disease doctors to see a full copy of a patient\'s clinical biography ahead of an appointment.\n\nMyEyeSite was developed to address these problems by providing a platform for patients to collect, link, and share their specialist rare disease data in a secure, systematic, and structured way.',solution:"Our team engaged patients, doctors, and researchers as collaborators to design and develop the MyEyeSite application.
